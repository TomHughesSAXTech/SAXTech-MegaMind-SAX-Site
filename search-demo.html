        <div class="question">How does SAX handle cryptocurrency and digital currency tax matters?</div>
        <div class="answer">SAX provides comprehensive guidance on cryptocurrency and digital currency taxation, following both federal and New Jersey state regulations. The firm's approach includes:

Convertible virtual currency (including Bitcoin and NFTs) must be reported in U.S. dollars at fair market value on the transaction date. Virtual currency is classified as intangible property, not tangible personal property, which has significant tax implications.

For New Jersey residents and businesses:
• Virtual currency purchases for investment are not subject to Sales Tax
• Receiving virtual currency as payment for goods/services IS subject to sales tax
• Out-of-state businesses selling virtual currency to NJ customers must comply with state taxing requirements
• Virtual currency received as wages must be valued at fair market value and converted to USD

SAX's State & Local Tax (SALT) team specializes in demystifying complex virtual currency transactions. The firm conforms to federal tax treatment for gains/losses on virtual currency sales and exchanges, ensuring proper income tax withholding when crypto is paid as wages.

For assistance with cryptocurrency tax matters, contact Edvin Givargis (SALT Partner) at egivargis@saxadvisorygroup.com or John Nunes (Tax Manager) at jnunes@saxadvisorygroup.com.</div>
