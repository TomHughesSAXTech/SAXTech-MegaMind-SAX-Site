# Format Agent Response Node Update Instructions

## Nodes to Update
You need to update the following nodes in the "SAXTech MegaMind SAX" workflow:
1. Format Agent Response1
2. Format Agent Response2
3. Format Agent Response4

## Update Process
For each node:
1. Open the workflow in n8n
2. Double-click on the Format Agent Response node
3. Replace the entire code in the JavaScript field with the code from: `n8n-format-agent-response-FINAL-FIX.js`
4. Save the node
5. Repeat for all Format Agent Response nodes

## What This Fixes
This update fixes the voice ID passthrough issue by:
- Looking through all input items to find voice data
- Checking multiple possible field names (voiceId, selectedVoice, voice)
- Checking nested data structures
- Properly passing voice data to the output

## Key Changes
- Added comprehensive search through $input.all() to find voice data
- Added fallback checks for different voice field names
- Added debug logging to track voice data flow
- Ensures voice data is properly passed through to the response

## Testing
After updating, test by:
1. Sending a request with Tom's voice ID: "gWf6X7X75oO2lF1dH79K"
2. Check the response to ensure voiceId is "gWf6X7X75oO2lF1dH79K" (not Rachel's "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL")
3. Monitor console logs to see the voice data flow

## Important Note
The main problem was that the Format Agent Response nodes were only looking at the immediate input from the AI Agent, not the original context data that was passed through the workflow chain. This fix searches through all available inputs to find the voice data wherever it might be in the data flow.
