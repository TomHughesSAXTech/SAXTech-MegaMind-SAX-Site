# OCR Workflow Diagnostic Analysis
Generated: 2025-01-15 00:51:59 UTC

## Issue Summary
The webhook receives 3 image attachments correctly, but they're not being processed by Azure OCR.

## Diagnostic Findings

### 1. Webhook Stage ✅
- Successfully receives POST request
- Body contains:
  - sessionId: `mschat_session_e14e9cf7-8343-4a2f-8e3e-2cf69ffe9f56`
  - message: User's message
  - attachments: 3 screenshots (base64 encoded)
  - userProfile: Complete user information

### 2. Prepare OCR Data Stage ✅
- Correctly identifies 3 attachments
- Sets `hasAttachments: true`
- Sets `attachmentCount: 3`
- Processes each attachment:

  - screenshot_1757896893209.png

- Converts base64 to binary Buffer for each

### 3. Has Attachments Check ✅
- Condition evaluates to TRUE
- Should route to "Send to Azure OCR" node

### 4. Problem Identified ❌
The flow stops after "Has Attachments?" node. The Azure OCR node is not being triggered.

## Root Cause
The "Prepare OCR Data" node is outputting multiple items (one per attachment), but the "Has Attachments?" IF node only evaluates the first item. When true, it should pass ALL items to the OCR node, but the connection or data flow is broken.

## Solution Required
The workflow needs to ensure that when multiple binary items are created, they all flow through to the Azure OCR node for processing. The IF node might be blocking the multi-item flow.

## Next Steps
1. Check if the workflow is active in n8n
2. Verify the connection between "Has Attachments?" true branch and "Send to Azure OCR"
3. Consider using a Split In Batches node if needed for sequential processing
4. Ensure the Azure OCR node is configured to handle binary data from the "data" field
